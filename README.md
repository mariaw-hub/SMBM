# SMBM
A soil moisture balance model based on the FAO bucket approach to estimate soil water within a homogenous soil column.
The repository contains code for the following analysis: 
1. Climate data analysis including temperature, relative humidity, precipitation, soil moisture and PET. 
2. Penman Monteith method to calculate PET. 
3. Soil moisture balance model (SMBM) for the coastal site. 

Input Data
The data can be downloaded from http://www.geog.ucsb.edu/ideas/. It is continously updating and collecting data at a high resolution interval (15min) and can be downloaded as a .txt file. The analysis only includes data from 2008 until October 2019.
